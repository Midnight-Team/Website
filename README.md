<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great Discord bots out there, and all of them are really popular and useful. But have you wondered, how those bots work inside and want a bot as your own? Have you always wanted a good discord bot so your server setup is much easier to do, and it to be open sourced? Well, Midnight is the right bot for you!

Here's why:
* üìå 200+ Commands to do literally anything -- From moderation to music.
* üñ•Ô∏è Fully functioning dashboard so that you can configure your server's settings and add custom commands from there.
* üí¨ Also easy to self-host with basic Node.js/Typescript and JSON knowledge. **Note that no self-hosting support will be provided.**

Any bugs, command suggestions or contributions can be done through the GitHub issues or in my [Support Server](https://discord.gg/QPt2CngC9s)
